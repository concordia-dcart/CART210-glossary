## Quantum Cryptography

Quantum cryptography has a goal to secure communications and uses principles of quantum mechanics to do so. This opposes the traditional way of using computational mathematical abilities. Quantum cryptography provides information-theoretic security based on the fundamental laws of physics [^1citation].

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is the basis of this type of cryptography. It’s a technique that enables two parties to share encryption keys in a way that is provably secure against any computational attack. In other words, it’s a system that allows quantum-encoded information to be sent, and it can also alert the communicating parties if there are any issues [^2citation].

The idea of quantum cryptography originated in the early 1970s, but it was formally introduced in 1984 by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard [^3citation]. Since then, this field has expanded into real-world applications, including the Micius satellite, which enabled the first intercontinental quantum-secured video call [^4citation].

Despite its promise, quantum cryptography faces challenges, including photon loss in optical fibers. However, ongoing research into quantum repeaters and satellite-based is expected to address these limitations[^5citation].
