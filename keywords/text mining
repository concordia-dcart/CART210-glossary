## text mining

Text mining, often called text data mining or text analytics, is the process of extracting 
useful information, patterns, and insights from text data[^Tanmining]. 
This requires a variety of methodologies and tools from disciplines such as linguistics, 
data science, and computer science[^monkmining]. The purpose of text mining is to turn unstructured text 
into structured data that can be studied or utilized to make better decisions, comprehend trends, 
and discover hidden patterns[^Tanmining]. Here are some important characteristics and applications of text mining: 
Information retrieval, natural language processing (NLP), and text analysis[^ibmminig].
