## stable-diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a deep-learning model designed for generating high-quality images from text prompts. Developed by Stability AI and released in 2022, it is an open-source latent diffusion model (LDM) that enables users to create photorealistic and artistic images with greater accessibility. Compared to earlier AI image generators, Stable Diffusion offers improved efficiency, control, and customization, making it a significant tool in digital art and media production.[^rombach22high]

Stable Diffusion operates using diffusion models, which gradually refine an image from noise through iterative denoising. Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which often struggle with mode collapse and high computational costs, diffusion models generate more consistent and high-resolution results. [^ho20denoising] This technology has led to widespread applications in digital art, game development, and AI-assisted design, shaping the future of new media and creative industries.

Stable Diffusion is particularly important in new media studies due to its impact on AI-generated content, digital storytelling, and interactive media. As an open-source tool, it enables artists and developers to create customized AI models, democratizing access to advanced image-generation technology. Moreover, its ability to synthesize high-fidelity visuals from simple text descriptions aligns with contemporary generative media trends, allowing for new forms of creative expression and digital content production.
