## Multimedia

Multimedia refers to the integration of multiple media to deliver a richer message than one single form of media.[^Li21multimedia] By manipulating text, images, 
data and videos through technology (both modern and traditional forms) and including user interaction, one may allow more dimension for expression.

Earlier forms of multimedia included newspapers, one of the first mass communication mediums and one in which included text, imagery, and graphics. Over time, hardware used to create multimedia continued to improve, from rudamentary devices like phonograms
and wooden box cameras to CDs and Instant Cameras. Eventually, all the content captured by hardware went from analog media to digital media, marking a shift in how we could share and interact with media. This continuous improvement in hardware and shift in media allowed increased experimentation and expression using multimedia tools. Nowadays, with new digital media, users are now actively engaged with their "social ecosystem" rather than passively consuming media.[^Li21multimedia] 

More modern applications of Multimedia are thought to date back to the early 1960's, with interactive installations such as Ivan Sutherland and Bob Sproull's "The Ultimate Display".[^history30ultimate] The proposed installation involved a computer interpreting beams of light and outputting them into a small screen on a helmet.[^brown17virtual] The Ultimate Display was effectively the ancestor of modern virtual reality technologies, combining creative computation, physics and imagery to generate virtual objects. With the evolution of software and hardware in the 20th and 21st centuries, interactive programs like video games and social media emerged as some of the most commercial and prevalent forms of multimedia entertainment.
