## GPU

A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to accelerate image rendering and complex computational tasks. Originally developed for graphics rendering in video games, GPUs have evolved into powerful parallel processors widely used in artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and data analysis.[^fatahalian08gpu] Their ability to process multiple calculations simultaneously makes them essential for modern computing.

### Historical Background  
The concept of GPUs emerged in the late 20th century as computer graphics became more advanced. In the 1990s, companies like NVIDIA and ATI (now part of AMD) pioneered dedicated graphics hardware to offload rendering tasks from the CPU.[^owens07survey] The introduction of programmable shaders in the early 2000s marked a significant shift, allowing developers to harness GPU power beyond graphics. The General-Purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) movement further expanded their use into scientific research, machine learning, and blockchain technology.[^kirk10gpu]

### Significance in New Media  
In the field of new media, GPUs play a crucial role in real-time rendering, video processing, and interactive digital environments. They enable photorealistic graphics, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and high-performance computing applications.[^pharr19physically] The ability of GPUs to process large amounts of data efficiently aligns with contemporary digital media practices, from 3D animation to deep learning models used in content generation. Moreover, platforms such as Unreal Engine and Unity leverage GPU acceleration to create immersive experiences.

### Contemporary Applications  
Beyond gaming and media production, GPUs have become indispensable in scientific visualization, cryptocurrency mining, and artificial intelligence research.[^goodfellow16deep] Frameworks like CUDA (developed by NVIDIA) and OpenCL enable programmers to utilize GPU parallelism for deep learning, financial modeling, and real-time simulations. Cloud computing services now offer GPU instances, further integrating them into large-scale data processing.

### Key Contributors  
Several key figures have contributed to GPU development. NVIDIA co-founder Jensen Huang played a significant role in advancing GPU technology and promoting its use in AI.[^nvidiahistory] The academic work of researchers like John D. Owens and David Kirk has also been influential in optimizing GPU performance for non-graphics applications.
