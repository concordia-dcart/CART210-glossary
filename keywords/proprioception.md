## Proprioception

In definition, proprioception is often described as the “sixth sense”, providing unique input beyond the five traditional senses. It is perceiving our body's position and movement in space without relying on visual or tactile cues. The term was intiially coined by English neurophysiologist Charles Scott Sherrington, to describe the positioning of body segments in space. Sherrington built upon existing literature and derived the word from the Latin "proprius," meaning one's own, and perception, thus literally designating one's own perception [^1]. This unconscious awareness enables us to comprehend how the parts of our body and mind relate to each other as well as how they interact with the environment. Unlike the five senses, it is less consciously discerned but plays a crucial role in embodiment, self-understanding and sensory interpretation [^2][^3]. 

From a metaphysical standpoint, proprioception blurs the lines between the mind and body. Dualistic frameworks outlined by classical philosophy separate the mind from the body, but proprioception demonstrates an integrated model where bodily awareness and one’s mental state are interdependent [^4]. Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty argues that perception is not a passive vessel for external stimuli, but rather an active bodily engagement with the world [^5]. This said, If I know my hand’s position through an immediate, pre-reflective sense, then my mental state is inseparable from my physical state. Thus the mental and physical are not only correlated, but co-constitutive. Further discussions on the role of proprioception on the self are perhaps beyond the scope of this keyword, though classmates can consult “Perception and the Physical World” by D.M Armstrong [^6] for further explorations on the influence of the senses. 

Keeping this in mind, In traditional art, the viewer’s role is often passive, simply observing. New media however, often demands active participation, leveraging proprioception explicitly, engaging the body as both medium and participant. Proprioception’s significance continues to grow as artists seek immersive and interactive experiences that engage the user's entire body through various mediums and technologies, including VR & AR, interactive installations, or more general haptic technologies. New media experiences often respond to the user’s physical body in real-time, relying heavily on integrating proprioceptive information with the visual and auditory stimuli, or incorporating haptic feedback into digital environments, allowing developers to create more realistic, intuitive, and engaging interactions [^2][^7] Haptic devices provide tactile feedback, simulating the sense of touch and allowing users to interact with virtual objects in a more tangible way as the sense of touch provides crucial information about the body's interaction with its surroundings [^8]. Thus, the body’s state shapes the artwork, while the artwork reshapes the participant’s awareness of their body. This mirrors Merleau-Ponty’s idea of perception as a bodily dialogue with the world, with the inclusion of a responsive technological layer giving tangible output in the form of art.

To expand and finish, in class, we examined "Osmose" by Char Davies, which immerses users in virtual environments controlled by their movements through VR. Their proprioceptive sense of balance and motion dictated their navigation through ethereal, dreamlike spaces. The artwork does not simply represent a static idea, it responds to the user’s body, blending mental immersion with physical action. This creates a unified experience between output and input, mediated by technology, forming a continuous, hybrid self that includes the technological environment [^9]. We can define proprioception through a posthuman lens, If proprioception reveals a mind-body unity, art like the “Cloud Core Scanner” by Agnes Meyer-Brandis [^10], where participants "feel" cloud textures via haptic feedback, extends that unity into a symbiosis. One's bodily awareness informs the artwork, which reshapes awareness in turn, mediated by sensors and code. This aligns with Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto [^11], where boundaries between human and machine dissolve, and proprioception becomes a shared property to be explored.
