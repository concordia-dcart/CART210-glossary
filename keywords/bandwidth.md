The term bandwidth often characterizes the amount of data that the network can transfer per unit of time. It refers to either the range of frequencies encompassed by electromagnetic signals or the transformation qualities of communication system. Bandwidth related to data networks specifically measures the rate of data transfer accross a network link or path.[^ravi]

The concept of Bandwitdh is really central to digital communication and new media, as it relates to the amount of data a link or network path can deliver, impacting directly aplication performation such as file transfer, or multimedia streaming.[^ravi]

On the paper written by Slepian dated from 1976, he encompasses the concept of accessibility on the manner of Bandwidth arguing the paradox of limiting bandwidth with the abstraction of "It is easy- to ugw that red signals must be bandlimited. It is Plso easy to argue that they annot be so." [^slepian] This leads to the question: "Are signals really bandlimited?".
