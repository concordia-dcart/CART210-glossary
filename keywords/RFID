## Radio Frequency Identification

RFID is a method for wirelessly identifying objects, animals, or humans using electromagnetic fields.[^amslerRFID] 
It consists of three major components: an RFID tag (or transponder) encoded with digital information,[^weinstRFID] 
a reader (or interrogator) that sends and receives radio waves, and an antenna for signal transmission.[^amslerRFID] 
The reader activates the tag, which then returns data to the reader, turning radio waves into useful 
information.[^juelsRFID] This method enables the tracking and administration of goods without direct touch or 
line-of-sight.[^juelsRFID] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fijdpALiaqE
