## RGB
RGB colorspace stands for “Red, Green Blue” colorspace, which is considered an “additive” color model. It is considered additive due to the range of colors being created by adding wavelengths of the main colors together in different proportions. [^zelazko225rgbcolor]
This colorspace is usually used in screens and digital devices. Although different color depths exist for different screens, the most common way of referring to RGB colors is the HEX notation, characterized by 6 hexadecimal (0 to F) values. [^christensson19rgb] This notation is used due to the 24-bit color (256 values per color) being the nearest to the color spectrum visible to humans, making two hexadecimals per color perfectly represent those colors. [^christensson19rgb]

The idea of RGB colorspace was created because of a previous finding by Thomas Young in 1802, who proposed that the human eye had three cone cells. The colors corresponding to those cone cells were later discovered in 1851 by Hermann von Helmholtz. From there, in 1861, James Clerk Maxwell proposed the RGB color model, demonstrating it with photography plates of an image (of a tartan ribbon) that were taken with different filters. [^rhyne17applying] From then on, the RGB colorspace has been what we consider as the "light" colorspace. Other species who have different color cones in their eyes will see color differently than us, therefore would necessitate a different colorspace model. 

Although RGB is universal, the colors are display dependent, meaning that the colors for a same hexadecimal may appear differently on different screens. [^ibraheem12understanding] This is mostly due to variations in the manufacturing of the different layers of the screen, as well as the display technology used (LED vs OLED). [^benq22why]

The theory of RGB is very useful in new media, as the use of screens and lights are very common. Utilising different colors and color mixes in new media will necessitate a basic knowledge in RGB colorspace, as well as some knowledge of CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), and other models such as HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity), used for digital illustration, or RYB (Red, Yellow, Blue), used for painting. RBG and HSI have also been used together in Deep learning to optimize image denoising (using two colorspaces to add more data and therefore more definition to the denoising)[^Deng24rgb]
