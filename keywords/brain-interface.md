Brain Interfaces, also often referred to as Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), are devices that measure brain activity and translate it into control signals for machines (such as computers) to execute tasks[^gentle2010]. In other words, BCI allow for a brain and a machine to directly communicate [^interface2022]. Using BCI, the execution of a task requires no movement or usage of muscles. 

Brain-Computer Interfaces first rely on measuring brain activity. This is achieved by using methods that detect the electrical signals generated in specific regions of the brain by networks of neurons communicating with each other when a person performs a given cognitive task.  A non-invasive method of doing this is electroencephalography (EEG), which refers to reading brain activity by using electrodes placed on the scalp [^gentle2010]. Other more invasive methods exist, such as surgically implanted electrodes that are either placed on the surface of the cortex or penetrate brain tissue [^gentle2010]. 

For the machine to be able to ''understand'' what intent the brain activity is trying to convey, the recorded signals need to be processed. It is important to note that different cognitive tasks generate distinct discernable and classifiable brain activity patterns. For instance, sensorimotor rhythms, a distinct type of brain waves, have characteristic features like frequency and amplitude[^gentle2010]. After some filtering out of possible artefacts and noise, the principal features of the signals are extracted. Once the BCI has properly processed and categorized the pattern, it can find the associated command and execute the task. 

Brain Interfaces were first developed to aid individuals facing motor issues[^interface2022]. Tasks like being able to move in a space or communicating with others can become inhibited by various neurodegenerative diseases. For example, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease which affects neurons controlling motor ability, can result in Locked-In syndrome (being physically paralyzed but cognitively sound)[^gentle2010]. BCI gives an opportunity for these people to utilize their brain as an extension of their physical body. They get to interact with the world regardless of their ability. This technology has great potential in the medical field by making communication and movement more accessible.

This technology also has applications in the field of new media art. In fact, one of the earliest applications of BCI was in American composer Alvin Lucier's ''Music for Solo Performer'', where Lucier's alpha brain waves, detected by an EEG headset, activate various percussive instruments[^autodesk2018][^interface2022]. Lucier's BCI was developed by scientist Edmond Dewan; a great example of science and art collaboration! Another example is the performance ''Dual Brains'' by artists Eva Lee and Aaron Trocola, in which the two wear connected EEG headsets and generate sounds and visuals based on their mental states; what is demonstrated is the result their empathic interactions (hand holding, proximity)[^autodesk2018]. In this sense, Brain-Computer Interfaces exert a dual function. They serve as innovative tools to give shape to the formal characteristics of a piece and they act as a new, expansive conceptual framework that artists can explore by creating pieces about related subjects like accessibility, imagination or embodiment.
