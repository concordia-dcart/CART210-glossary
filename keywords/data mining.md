**Data Mining**
Data mining is described as a “involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previous unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets”[^Seifert] and that data mining tools have different models such as statistical models, mathematical algorithms, and machine learning methods. Data mining doesn’t just consist of collecting and managing data, but it also includes analysis and predictions. 

Data mining is used for a various of purpose whether it would be private or public sectors. Data mining is used in banking, insurance, medicine and retailing to reduce costs, enhance research and increase sales. There are examples of data mining being used such as in banks, to detect fraud and assist in risk assessment and uses customer’s data to learn about if they are in good credit scoring or if it will detect any fraudulent insurance claims.[^Seifert]

Data mining is considered a “powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tool which can discover useful information by analyzing data from many angles or dimensions, categorizing that information and summarize the relationship identified in the database”[Algarni]  one of the main process used in data mining is knowledge discovery which is essentially “a process of nontrivial extraction of implicit, unknown and potential information from a large database.”[^Algarni] it is considered to be the most interactive process and examines many decisions made by the user.

When it comes to the influence of data mining in digital culture and society, it’s important to know that data mining is everywhere, it is used on social media such as sending twitter (now X) post on the website, humidity of shipping crates which in studies of a lot of data accumulated is equivalent to a zettabyte of data or sextillion bytes and growing. There is new analytical knowledge driven by accompanying forms of data mining and analytics. One of the most important parts of data mining and digital culture is “these companies and their analytic methods promise to help us gain insight into public opinion, mood, networks, behaviour patterns and relationship”[^Andrejevic,Hearn,andKennedy] as for socially it is also mentioned how “Data analytics involve far more than target advertising, however; they envision new strategies for forecasting, targeting and decision-making in a growing range of social realms, such as marketing, employment, education, health care, policing, urban planning and epidemiology.”[^Andrejevic,Hearn,andKennedy] 

However, there are important role to play in considering the social and political consequence of data mining and analytics.  There is knowledge of “when every move we make online is tracked by privately owned corporations and the state, advertisements follow us around in material retail spaces, and even our sleep patterns become fodder for self-tracking (to gain ‘self-knowledge’) {…} by approaching them solely as communication media.”[^Andrejevic,Hearn,andKennedy]

Data mining is significant in new media as it allows companies, the internet to collect data that you have grown accustomed to and use it to advertise or push products to the user online or in person.  It is something very evident online of seeing advertisements of a product of any sort to try to elicit you to engage in it more.
