## Middleware

Middleware is a type of software that can best be viewed as a layer between different systems and the outcome of their collaboration. Examples of these different systems are applications, databases, and operating systems. Examples of the outcomes of these systemsâ€™ collaboration are single sign-on (SSO) and API management. In other words, it simplifies the integration between various components to provide efficient and reliable services. [^1citation]

Middleware first made its appearance in a 1968 NATO Software Engineering report. Originally, the term designated the software that sat between application programs and service routines.[^2citation] Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, the exponential growth of the internet led to new middleware technologies being designed to support distributed systems. Today, middleware continues to be a term used to describe a wide range of services that are essential for building complex applications that are distributed.

By far, the most important role of middleware is in cloud computing. The foundation for modern cloud-native architecture is middleware. It allows developers to safely and efficiently scale applications across hybrid environments. The main advantage of middleware is that it creates reliable core application features rather than handling complex system interactions that are error prone. The main disadvantage is that the initial setup and maintenance of middleware systems can be complex.[^3citation]

In the 21st century, computing continues to evolve, thus the role of middleware is more important than ever. Done properly, middleware is a vital service that enable applications to communicate an across a wide range of platforms. Incorrectly chosen, middleware can slow down the process by producing bottleneck issues.[^4citation]
