## Search Engine Optimization


Search Engine Optimization, also known as SEO, optimizes websites to help users find content faster and more efficiently. By developing SEO, websites are pushed to the top of the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), which allows users to engage with website content promptly. SEO also helps improve website traffic since users typically visit the top pages from their search query [^mailchimpSEO]. SEO is fundamental for web development since users rarely click on links found on the following result pages. 

Search Engine Optimization helps search engines understand the content on a website so it can process the information to help people discover content. SEO is widely used in new media for digital marketing purposes [^zilincanSEO]. To allow businesses to thrive and gain a lot of engagement with their clients they must be easily found through search engines. It helps to increase the customer base and website credibility as well. There are two types of SEO: on page and off-page optimization [^santhoshSEO]. On page delves into modifying the content and structure of a webpage like the schema and source code and adding content-specific keywords[^zilincanSEO]. Off-page SEO delves into gathering a user base from outside platforms to link to the targeted web page.

Search Engine Optimization is important in new media, since it shapes how users interact with digital content and determines what the user base sees. It structures content through SERPs and defines how it is interpreted within the digital space of the search engine[^mailchimpSEO].  SEO dictates how content is ranked, who can access it, and how algorithms influence its visibility and interpretation.
