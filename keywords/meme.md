## Meme

*Meme* is an abstract form of communication usually allowing the transfer of information from one to the other. The term was first proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book, The Selfish Gene. Memes in their most common form are comedic internet items shared publicly on social spaces.

Due to the nature of this course, we will primarily be focussing on the nature and history of said internet memes.

### History

There is no way to definitely prove what the first internet meme was. However, most scholars agree that this was likely the first *meme*. 

:-)

This simple emoticon representing a smiley face was first created by Scott Fahlman in 1982. However it was only by 1993 that using the term meme to represent this online communication was suggested[^godwin-meme].

Since :-) memes have vastly evolved, mainly inline with technology.

### 2000s
In the 2000s, most internet users would either communicate on forums based on their hobbies, or a very minor list of generalized forums such as the now defunct Something Awful. This meant memes were created in much more isolated environments and were often closely tied to the culture they originated from. [^shifman-digital]

However, white collar workers also had access to this technology and would also often share memes in email chains and the like.
#### Examples:
[Dancing Baby](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dancing-baby)
[All Your Bases are Belong to Us](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-your-base-are-belong-to-us)
[O RLY](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/o-rly)
[Pedobear](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pedobear)

### 2005s
The 2005s introduced YouTube and video sharing to world of internet memes. Additionally, generalized places of discussion were now becoming the norm with Reddit and Digg. The first social media website had also been launched, MySpace, which allowed users to tie their real life identity to their online one.
#### Examples:
[Rick Roll](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll)
[Chocolate Rain](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/chocolate-rain)
[Dramatic Chipmunk](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dramatic-chipmunk)
[Advice Dog](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-dog)

### 2010s
In the 2010s, the internet became mainstream. Due the advent of social media sites such as Facebook and an increase in computer and phone ownership, the general public now used the internet. This had a major effect on meme culture, seeing much more widespread use.
#### Examples:
[Rage Comics](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/rage-comics)
[Loss](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss)
[David After Dentist](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/david-after-dentist)
[Bad Luck Brian](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-luck-brian)

### 2015s
This era is quite important to talk about. In 2016, Donald Trump won the election. Most political analysts attribute a major factor of this win to Trumps online presence[^moreno-monsters]. After this election memes were no longer seen as simple jokes shared around. Memes were now seen as political power, dogwhistle and indoctrination tactics.

Internet memes of this era also began self regurgitation. As memes have now become a cultural artifact, old memes carry new meaning in modern use. Memes as a concept were challenged as information-less memes became prominent.[^post-memes]

[Video Games Appeal to the Male Fantasy](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/video-games-appeal-to-the-male-fantasy)

### 2020s and on
As years go by, the percentage of people born after the internet and widespread meme culture grows and grows. Memes have become a common way of communication, with certain groups of children primarily communicating in the media they consume online.
#### Examples:
[Erm, What the Sigma?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/erm-what-the-sigma)
[Misheard Lyrics](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/misheard-song-lyric-speech-bubbles)

# Chinese Meme Culture

We cannot discuss internet meme culture without discussing Chinese Meme Culture. Modern Chinese culture is deeply tied to internet meme culture. Though not as thoroughly apparent to western society, china went through a visual renaissance[^poplin-china] with the use of memes. In china, memes are commonly spread with anti establishment and counter culture messaging. 

For [example](https://b23.tv/veOrYve), a current modern trend is for random individuals to essentially 'trauma dump' while using a comedic filter.
