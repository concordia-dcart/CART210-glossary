## Haptics

*Tool: [DALL-E Free AI Generator](https://www.dall-efree.com/). Prompt: “Create an image that visually represents the concept of haptic technology. Futuristic environment where a person is interacting with a variety of advanced devices. Person is wearing a VR headset with a haptic feedback vest and gloves. Include representations of the person interacting with holograms. The setting should have a high-tech, immersive atmosphere, with a sense of interaction between the digital and physical worlds. The overall tone should be sleek and futuristic.”*

"Haptic" technology is a long researched technology that aims to enhance user interactions by providing tactile feedback through various devices, creating a more immersive and responsive experience.
These devices can be practically anything, though some commonly known haptic devices are often smartphones, game controllers, VR systems, and even prosthetics.
"Haptics" often use mechanical (vibration, pressure, motion), and / or more non-traditional (ultrasonics, electrostatics, thermal) stimulations to create the illusion of a physical touch in virtual, or at least seperate, environments. [^yuxiang_shi_2024_feedback]

These technologies can be tracked to have originated in the mid 19th century, with some of the earliest uses of haptics having been recorded to have occured in the 1960s and 70s.
One of the oldest representations of the use of haptics was a system that was meant to help show images to the blind. 
It was created by neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita, and took the shape of a chair that an array of movable metal rods. [^paul_bach-y-rita_1969_sense]
These rods would be gently pushed into the back of the user, maintaining a certain shape, serving a similar purpose as do pixels on a screen.
Users were shown to be able to recognize pictures that were poked into their backs, essentially acting as a sensory substitution for eyesight.

Another particulary interesting case in the early use of haptics was the invention of "Aura Interactor" sensory feedback vest. [^mike_klasco_2024_aura]
The vest was designed to provide force-feedback for video games by converting low-frequency sound into vibrations, allowing a player to feel in-game impacts like punches or nearby explosions.
It contained a large vibrating motor that would respond to sounds that were heavy in bass, and had a few different physical sliders to modulate strength.

### Relation to New Media and Modern Definition

"Haptics" only seem to find themselves being used more and more as time goes on, likely due to humanity finding itself to always be so close to the digitalized technologies around them.

Smartphones have, for many years now, harnessed simple haptics by form of vibrations, often to signal to a user that their interaction has caused a change, or that their attention was required.
Most game controllers feature haptic feedback that simulates different levels of resistance in an environment.
Many ATM machines and card terminals use haptics to confirm button presses and transactions.

In virtual reality, haptics have entered a sort of gold rush.
A large variety of both new and established companies have taken to experimenting with different haptics technologies in an attempt to find a viable and more immersive form of haptics.
Many of the new devices created have been vests, gloves, and even masks, all utilizing experimental forms of haptics technologies such as:

- "Microfluidic Tactile Actuators" that use tiny, fluid-filled channels and chambers to simulate textures, pressure, and deformation
- Robotic Exoskeletons that lock in place around objects to simulate grip
- Electro-Muscle Stimulators that deliver small shocks to simulate a feeling of touch
- Scent Cartridges that are triggered to simulate virtual smells

This is very much not a comprehensive list, with many such technologies have similar results that are achieved in different ways.

Through these uses, haptics have shown themselves to be a sort of delivery system of digital information to the physical world.
In the modern sense I would define haptics as a technology and science of creating, simulating, and perceiving touch-based sensations through electronic devices.
