## Copyright 

Copyright is a system of law that allows creators to claim ownership of their ideas and creations. Copyright has always existed mostly as a form of dynamic law,
in order to enforce creative freedom within the confines of free use and distribution. Globally, copyright laws were created as early as the 16th century, only seeking to evolve
as societies moved into industrialization and from industrialization to data and service-driven systems. In the legal world of copyright, the Copyright Act of 1909 in the US
coined the idea of the "right of first publication,"[^CASE] which gave all published works copyright to their original publishers for an unlimited time, which less for legal purposes
and more for intellectual property rights-related reasons. However, having your work *registered* under a copyright takes it out of the public domain and it remains so 
until a significant amount of time after you die[^UPENN]. 

Copyright is an idea that acts in direct opposition to a "free-use" information model that a lot of creatives value for things such as collaboration, inspiration and innovation. It's
also impossible to discuss copyright as a concept without also acknowledging the damage copyright has done in our present-day ultracapitalist society, which commodifies creativity 
and profits off of maintaining ideas that are inherently harmful to the ability of creatives to flourish. Because copyright naturally opposes free-use and open-source collaboration models 
(which are healthy and beneficial methods of creating and distributing work), copyright when used in the modern age can actively damage an artist's ability to create what they wish.
Because creative services and tools almost never are actually owned by the artist[^GNU], they are complicit in the work that they are used to create, and this can be exploited to claim any work
made with them under the copyright purview of that service's distributors. This also goes for corporate artists and designers that work under a larger company, which means that none of their
work can be attributed directly to them or be shared/expanded upon without conflicting with the company's "property". 

Copyright ironically started as a way for creators to take back what was theirs and make sure it isnt commodified and distributed unwillingly. Unfortunately, the concept has been twisted
and exploited to create a reality where it serves the opposite purpose, neccessitating the need for creatives to go the extra mile to make sure their art is ACTUALLY protected while still being
shared effectively and in ways that are beneficial to like-minded creators. The idea that a tool meant to make life easier or more personal for people that ends up being a figurative bullet in the
foot, is a common trend amongst innovations, and could continue to happen with new tools and methods, such as LLM's and AI tools. How these tools will follow this trend is unclear to us at the 
moment, but there's no doubt that due to their volatile nature, they should be treated with caution and regulated in the same way copyright has been.
