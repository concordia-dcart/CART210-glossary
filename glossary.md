The Application Programming Interface (API) is responsible for transmitting data from one device to another by taking in a request and responding with the data requested.[^mulesoft15what]

A main advantage of using an API to communicate between the client and the server rather than sending a direct query to the databases is that it protects the database from potential security risks. It also allows developers to keep a similar syntax when requesting data from any type of database. [^dreanfactory2023understanding]
The purpose of an API is to provide the client, whether a mobile application, website or other software, the information to build their product.

There are APIs for different purposes. For example, if making an application that gives information on the weather, an API for the weather would be used to gather the necessary information. The developer or client would send a request to the API server that would return a response including some data. Using APIs also helps construct flexible applications by allowing developers to add functionalities easily to an existing project.[^aws24what] 

Anyone can easily integrate APIs into their projects by searching for them online. However, they are mostly implemented by programmers since it is not meant to be used by the end-user.[^wiki24api]

## Avatar

An avatar is a digital entity or body through which a human being can experience the events within a digital world, giving the user a “subject-position within a simulated environment, a vicarious body through which the player can act as an agent in a fictional world.”[^Castronova03avatar] 

The term takes its meaning from Hinduism, deriving from a Sanskrit word for “descent” and used to refer to the incarnations the Hindu god Vishnu on earth.[^Klevjer06avatar] This term has evolved to symbolize the body that we inhabit when visiting a virtual world, and that only exists there.[^Trepte/Reinecke10avatar]

The creation and use of avatars began mostly in entertainment media such as video games or virtual reality where they can be used by players to accomplish several gameplay related actions such as combat or communication.  But with the increasing popularity and accessibility of 3D art and 3D creation software, avatars have also found use in the creation of 3D artwork, from artistic screenshots to sceneries. The design of an avatar can be as grounded or fantastical as the user desires, ranging from human-like characters to fantastic beasts. Alongside this, the ever-increasing computing power and graphical capabilities of modern computers expand the options available in avatar creation, enabling users to create avatars with more and more sophisticated designs and details.

## Big Data
Big Data is the use of a large quantity of stored and analyzed information to form accurate understandings and predictions about the world. The wielding of this type of information processing has been accelerated by improvements in technology and the growing amounts of digital connections between people and organizations. [^AsktCite]

Big Data is used in everything from health care to political campaigns. Notably big data was a cornerstone of [Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns](http://www.jstor.org/stable/26466778) where personalized messaging and interaction were optimized by the assessment of potential voter preferences. [^LadonMurraycite] Large-scale data analysis was also used in the NBA to track player shooting accuracy. A sensor placed on the hoop would track and record the player’s shots from different points on the court. It would then be able to suggest where to shoot from to maximize winning potential. [^Ricecite] 
In both of these examples, real-world phenomena were tracked and enumerated. They were then sent through systems and by people who would find patterns that could predict outcomes.

## Blockchain

A blockchain is a shared and public ledger that stores data and is used to record transactions accross multiple computers. This database has a continuously growing list of information/records called blocks which are linked through cryptography. Every block stores a hash, history of the previous block, transactional data, date and time.[^berg18blockchain]

Blockchains are secure and maintain a decentralized record of transactions which is the reason they are used for (although not limited to) cryptocurrencies. There is no way to change a block therefore making it very safe and removes the need of third parties for transfers.[^kulhari18blockchain]

For example, blockchains are used in the monetary world for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum since it ensures transparency between transactions and protects the financial identity of individuals when they use crypto to buy or sell anything.[^segura23blockchain]

## Creative Commons

In an easy way to understand, Creative Commons is basically a fancy law regarding copyright. Essentially, why Creative Commons are so particular is because they are a more globally known copyright law which easier to use and more common. In simple terms, when an author uses Creative Commons on his work he's allowing users/readers to reuse their work on another.[^Harington20creativecommons] Moreover, the praticality of Creative Commons is also really important to know. In fact, when Creative Commons are used appropriately users don't have any financial, legal or politcal constraints. Basically, a worry-free enviornment for using people's content. [^Margoni16creativecommons]

With the concept now explained it's important to also know the format/protocols authors need to follow to apply Creative Commons licenses. To use these licenses there are four conditions that have to be met. These conditions can be mixed into six different licenses. To grasp this idea I recommend watching the following Youtube video. [^CreativeCommons17creativecommons] The last thing to remember from this is that at the end of the day the Creative Commons licenses come in three formats which are machine-readable, lawyer-readable and human-readable.

## Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies used by governments and centralized banks, the main idea is that cryptocurrencies attempt to operate on decentralized networks founded on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies rely on secure distributed ledger data structures; where mining is an integral part of Proof-of-Work systems. Mining requires the use of computer power to solve complex mathematical problems (encrypted transaction keys), validate transactions, and add them to the blockchain. A successful miner is rewarded with newly created cryptocurrency as an incentive.[^watorek21cryptocurrency] Other systems also exist such as Proof-of-Stake or PoS for short.[^mukhopadhyay16cryptocurrency] PoS relies on participants holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions and create new blocks, eliminating the need for intensive computational work. Cryptocurrency can typically be bought on trading exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase, but can also be bought and sold via peer-to-peer methods.[^wu21cryptocurrency] Digital currencies can also be stored on software-wallets and hardware-wallets. In most cases, the singular term cryptocurrency can mean a token. Some notable cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin, is considered as an Altcoin. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, new projects, cryptocurrencies, altcoins, systems, and use cases are being implemented.

## Cyberspace

Cyberspace’s current definition according to the CSRC (Computer Security Resource Center) is “The complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form.” [^bussel23wiki]

The term, cyberspace, has always meant a virtual “place” accessed through the internet by machines. When it first appeared in Omni Magazine in 1982, in a short story written by the Canadian-American author William Gibson, it was referred to as a computer network filled with artificial beings. In the same year, the movie Tron was released, depicting a completely digital world. This popularized the idea that computers shared a digital location in which one could interact with digital beings.[^csrc24wiki]

In the 1990s, due to the pop culture popularization of the term, the definition morphed into “The ‘location’ in which people interacted with each other while using the Internet.” It became the “space” where one played online games or interacted on forums and blogs. [^dclark10wiki]

## DNS
The Domain Name System is a system that matches the name in the URL to the IP address of the sites we are looking for on the Internet. This makes it easier for us to naviagte to our favorite websites rather than remembering their IP addresses.[^couldflare24what] The DNS provides the corresponding IP address to the domain name for browsers to find the page we are searching for.[^techquickie16dns]

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git,[^github24wikis] allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing. GitHub employs Git software, offering distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and project [wikis](../main/glossary.md#wiki).[^kinsta24what]

As of 2020, GitHub is the most important platform for collaborative Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development, with 31 million user accounts and over 100 million code repositories.[^zoller20topology] FLOSS development is associated with the idea of commons-based peer production, presenting it as a different approach to creating goods and services compared to traditional market or hierarchical methods. It is seen as a method for producing without the usual power imbalances.

GitHub's development process is distributed, allowing developers to collaborate, discuss, and comment on code from various locations. This platform generates a wealth of textual, numerical, and collaborative data, making it a prime source for software engineering research.[^seker20open]

## Haptics

The word “haptics” means ‘concerned with the sense of touch’ [^haptics1]. It is believed to have come from the Greek word “hapthesthai” [^haptics1]. In psychology and medicine, haptics refers to the study of how humans process sensory touch input through the body’s touch receptors [^haptics1]. In the late twentieth century, the definition had to be broadened because emergent technologies such as robots, video game consoles and virtual reality are all capable of creating touch sensations [^haptics2]. Thus, in the context of new media, haptics is defined as physical sensations—such as pushes or vibrations—that a user experiences while using an electronic device [^haptics3].

## Hashtag

A hashtag, denoted by the symbol “#”, is a metadata tag commonly use in the Internet culture, particularly on social media.[^Merriam-Webester24Hashtag]  It originated as a feature on a post on Twitterin August 2007 from a product designer named Chris Messina. The primary purpose was to provide user with an easy way to categorize, discover and participate in specific topics on social media.[^Hastags.org12Whatis#] In addition, Tweets containing hashtags can link to a specific timeline of other tweets with the same hashtag.[^WikströmHashtagOnTwitter]

Hashtags have significantly impacted the overall performance of social media content which can help small businesses, influencers, brands and many more to reach a bigger audience. A hashtag can contain multiple word without space, such as `#dogLover` and may also contain numbers. They can be added to social media posts, bios, comments, and other content. They are utilized across various platform, including Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and many more.[^SproutSocial23HashtagsWhatAreThey] 

In addition, hashtags can be useful in assisting people in need. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Instagram hashtags helped young people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by fostering scientific education and promoting remote learning.[^PublicHealth22Instagram]

## HTTPS

HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP but is more secure as it incorporates encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. It provides a secure method for transmitting data between a web server and a web browser by using encryption technology like SSL or TLS. It operates on a request-response model, it sends a request and awaits the server’s response.[^WhatIsHTTPS24]
HTTPS safeguards users against any malicious activities such as eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is relatively easy to impersonate, modify or monitor an HTTP connection since any information is sent as a plain text. Therefore, using HTTPS is more secure and ensure that no attacks can temper with the exchanged information.[^HypertextTransferProtocolSecure22]

### HTTPS Cryptographic protocols

#### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
SSL is the predecessor to the modern encryption, TLS. It was developed by Netscape in 1995[^CloudflareWhatIsSSL24] for ensuring the identity and authentication of a website, enabling a secure HTTP session between the client and the server. However, since SSL 3.0,  developed in 1996, several vulnerabilities have been identified, rendering it unsafe for use. Consequently, most browsers no longer support this protocol.

#### Transport Layer Security (TLS)
TLS is the successor of SSL and ensures privacy, authenticity and data security while exchanging data over the internet. The key difference between SSL and TLS lies in the handshake process, where a browser authenticates a server’s SSL or TLS certificate. SSL handshake involves an explicit connection and has more steps, while TLS is an implicit one, making it faster.[^AWSDifferenceBetweenSSL]

The term SSL and SSL/TLS both refer to the TLS protocol and certificates, as all version of SSL are now deprecated.

HTTPS contributes to a better overall user experience by providing faster loading times, especially on modern web browsers and prioritize secure connections. Additionally, search engines prioritize websites that use HTTPS in their search results.[^LinkedInHTTPSSEO24] It plays an important role in facilitating secure communication and interaction across various platform, including social media, streaming service and many more website. It does integrate an safety wall for the users navigating the web.

## Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that enables individuals around the world to communicate and exchange information. [^Zare24internet1] 

The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[^Zare24internet2] 
The term internet (or internetwork) is simply a contraction of the phrase inter-network. However, when written with a capital "I," the Internet refers to a global network of interconnected systems. [^Zare24internet3]

The Internet functions as an interactive medium, linking millions of devices and people. It facilitates data transmission, communication across several platforms, and access to a wide range of information. The Internet is naturally interactive, allowing computer users to communicate across networks. [^Zare24internet4] 

The Internet has empowered ordinary citizens by making it easier for them to produce and distribute information to a variety of audiences. This transformation has caused a fundamental shift in the traditional media landscape. [^Zare24internet5]

##Meme

Wikipedia defines a meme (/miːm/ MEEM) as an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. [^wikipedia24meme]

The term meme was introduced by the biologist Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. A meme is a unit of culture, such as “tunes, ideas, catch‐phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or building arches”. Dawkins defined memes as small cultural units of transmission, analogous to genes, which are spread from person to person by copying or imitation.  [^Dawkins76meme]

The phrase “Internet meme” is commonly applied to describe the propagation of content items such as jokes, rumors, videos, or websites from one person to others via the Internet. According to this popular notion, an Internet meme may spread in its original form, but it often also spawns user-created derivatives. [^Shifman13meme]

## Social Networking
The act of social networking refers to using any form of internet-based social media websites, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to stay connected with family and friends alike, while also sharing any multiple forms of media[^Kenton] (Kenton, 2023). From the examples listed, they each have different uses, for example, Instagram is a video and picture sharing application where others can like and share the things you upload. Twitter is a communication network, where users can share their thoughts by using hashtags. Lastly, Facebook is an application meant for connecting with friends and distant family members to remain in touch with them. The use of social networking can either be social, to communicate and interact with others online, or business, to talk about your field with likeminded individuals. It has changed “our means of gathering information and communicating with each other and contributing to both these practices through creative production”[^Fenton]. While there are some advantages about social networking there are also some disadvantages such as the spreading of misinformation, anonymity, and cause depressive symptoms, anxiety, and low self-esteem[^Pantic].

## Software

Software is a collection of commands or instructions that tell a computer how to behave [^software3]. It is opposite to hardware, which refers to all physical components of a computer [^software1].

## User
A user has many definitions, but let’s focus on the concept of an end user within the technology field. An end user is a person who utilizes a product or service such as a computer, software and many more, without involvement in its production or sell. Therefore, they are often referred to as customer and operator[^TheStateOfTheArtInEndUser]. End users typically have user accounts with usernames and passwords to authenticate themselves within a system.[^Chinel23Whatisuser]

The term "user" originates from the Old French word "user," meaning to employ or make use of, and also from Vulgar Latin "usare," which denotes making use of or taking advantage of something. The term "user" in the context of computers was invented in 1967. [^etymolineUser] One of the earliest instances of its use in the context of computing can be traced back to the pioneering work at institutions like the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society.[^StackExchangeWhyCalledUsers]

Understanding the needs of customers who utilize the product is important for developing the best product tailored for the intended users. In addition, gathering input from users through surveys, interviews, and testing can provide valuable feedback. This feedback can help identify areas for improvement and enable the customization of the user experience to better meet the users’ needs.[^Indeed23WhatIsAnEndUser]

Users interact with technology in various ways, including navigating interfaces, inputting commands, providing data, and receiving outputs. Therefore, user experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) play a crucial role in the success of a product or service. It is important to consider the end-user experience during the developing of the products and services.[^IntuitMailchimp24EndUser]

## Version Control

### Definition

Version Control Systems (VCS) are a type of software used in programming. Their purpose is to help manage code during the development of a project so as to ensure a proper workflow and effort coordination in the development team.

Namely, it keeps track of every change made in the project and by whom, it allows the possibility to protect certain versions of the code from being edited directly, and lets people work on different "branches" of the same code before merging them together, usually after being reviewed by at least another person. It's also useful when trying to find bugs in the code that appear in later versions by comparing it to older ones.[^Atlassian-VCS]

### Types of VCS

Version control systems are split between two distinct categories: Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). The main difference between the two is how the file repository is managed, CVCS using a unique centralized server as its name implies, while DVCS have each user keep a local repository on their computers.[^Zolkifli-VCS]

DVCS are the most commonly used, namely because it allows users to work without network connection, altough uploading and sharing the files requires being online, and the decentralized infrastructure allows for remote work from many different locations. Most systems in this category are free and open-source.

Alternatively, CVCS require a constant connection to the server to have access to the project files, and the single connection points means that, should server access be unavailable, work cannot be done and it is possible for changes to be lost. However, it does save space on the programmer's local machine considering they don't need to copy the full code on it, which is useful for complex and heavy projects.[^Gitlab-VCS]

### Examples of version control systems

- Git (DVCS)
- Bitbucket (DVCS)
- Mercurial (DVCS)
- Subversion (CVCS)
- Perforce (CVCS)

### Alternative names

- Source Code Management (SCM)
- Revision Control Systems (RCS)

## Virtual Environment

Virtual environments are the technology which facilitates interactions between users and computer-generated artificial environments.[^ve3] These interactive computer displays are designed to create the illusion that the user has been transported to a different location.[^ve1] In a virtual world, the user can use their senses and their body in a similar way to the real world. They can turn their head to see their surroundings, trace sounds to the direction they are coming from, and use their hands to pick up virtual objects [^ve2]. Virtual environments are thus the most natural form of interaction between humans and computers.[^ve2]

## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enables people to modify content by directly editing pages online.[^ebersbach05wiki] In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment.[^parker07wiki]

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham.[^anderson10wiki] In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

Wikis differ from traditional websites in that they are collaborative platforms that allow multiple users to create, edit, and organize content. Unlike traditional websites, wikis enable easy navigation between pages through interlinking and often have features such as revision history and discussion pages to track changes and facilitate communication among users. Wikis are commonly used for knowledge management, project collaboration, and intranet applications, and they can be utilized to display information, store corporate records, or serve as knowledge bases for various subjects. While traditional websites are typically front-end oriented, wikis act as a hybrid between an information system and an information displayer, allowing for quick and easy content creation and updates by users with minimal technical skills.[^hester09analysis]


There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](../main/glossary.md#GitHub).
